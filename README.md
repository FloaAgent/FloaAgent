# FLOA Agent Web

Core Positioning
Floa is an open intelligent Agent ecosystem, with its core product being cross-platform intelligent Agents that are creatable, trainable, verifiable, and monetizable.

Without requiring coding skills or professional expertise, users can train Agents through daily interactive tasks (e.g., conversational collaboration, task execution) to handle various digital affairs (e.g., asset allocation, scenario-specific service integration) and earn ecosystem rewards—serving as the "portable intelligent collaboration partner" for ordinary people to enter the era of intelligent Agents.

Floa’s most defining trait is "fair co-creation": 92% of tokens are exclusively generated through "Agent training," with no team allocations or private placements.

All users (individuals/institutions) gain rights and interests through genuine participation, fundamentally eliminating common industry issues such as centralized control and early-stage privileges.
